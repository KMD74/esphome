I searched the Internet for a way to control my Velux blinds, but could only find very simple, relay based ways to control the remote.
I figured I could try to make a more sleak and simple way of controling the remote control.
Using an ESP-module (ESP-07) I had laying around, I was able to access all functions of the remote.
The main goal was to have it integrated into Home Assistant.
This is the result!
