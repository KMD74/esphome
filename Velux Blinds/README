I searched the Internet for a way to control my Velux blinds, but could only find very simple, relay based ways to control the remote.

I figured I could try to make a more sleak and simple way of controling the remote control.
Using an ESP-module (ESP-12e) I had laying around, I was able to access all functions of the remote.
The goal was also to have it integrated into Home Assistant.

This is the result!

I am using a ESP-12e, but other ESP-modules could also be used.
What's important are the available GPIO-pins.
In this case 5 GPIO-pins are used: GPIO16, GPIO12, GPIO13, GPIO4 and GPIO5
The ESP also need to be enabled, which is done by connecting the ENABLE-pin to VCC.
